Known bugs in the code is listed here to allow keeping track of them

C-printer
=========
*Multi-dim arrays is not well tested. Multi-dim arrays inside structures does not do proper
 pinWrite (we never go deep into the arrays) hence if it works is by luck that the refed data
 has not been overwritten. The alloc, free, copy (of structs with multi-dim arrays) is printed
 but not really tested.
*Literal or mutable arrays directly used as a param in function or procedure
 call needs to be converted to a temp variable assignment and replace the array
 with the temp as the param.
*func, type or proc call param expressions that are none printable as expressions in c
 needs to be handled, e.g. nested type constructor calls which has in place arrays.
*Literal const structures are declared in c as the structure and not as a pointer to
 a structure, this is OK, but all the users of it needs to add a "&" since all other
 places assume all structures are pointers. Procedures are fixed but not function calls.


Front-end
==========
*Array lengths are not always checked, see L2-array c-warning in SortTest1



Notes
=====
*Guard assign same variable from peek multiple times since it is one peek per use in the guard expression,
 this is not per-se a bug but looks ugly.
